I am a research scientist at [Meta Reality Labs](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/), 
working on the future of communication and interactions in AR/VR, 
using machine learning techniques. 
Here's [my CV](https://kunhe.github.io/assets/pdf/cv_2023.pdf).

Currently, I am working on the broad topic of egocentric human sensing from computer vision and other sensing modalities.
Some relevant research problems that I have worked on include
human body/hand pose estimation, multi-view 3D reconstruction, domain adaptation, and active learning.

I graduated from [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu) in 2018 with PhD and MSc degrees in computer science. 
My advisor was [Professor Stan Sclaroff](https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/stan-sclaroff/). 
During grad school, I did research internships at Disney Research and Honda Research Institute, 
and I was a visiting student at Brown University.
I hold a Bachelor's degree in computer science from Zhejiang University, China.
