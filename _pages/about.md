I am a research scientist at 
[Meta Reality Labs](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/) (formerly Facebook Reality Labs), 
working on [the future of interaction tracking](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/hand-tracking-deep-neural-networks)
for Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, 
using computer vision and machine learning techniques. 

My current research interests include:
human body/hand pose estimation and tracking, domain adaptation, and active learning.

I graduated from [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu) in 2018 with PhD and MSc degrees in computer science. 
My advisor was [Professor Stan Sclaroff](https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/stan-sclaroff/). 
My PhD dissertation focused on learning vector embeddings for visual data, 
which finds application in image retrieval and other related computer vision tasks.
During grad school, I did research internships at Disney Research and Honda Research Institute, 
and I was a visiting student at Brown University.
I hold a Bachelor's degree in computer science from Zhejiang University, China.
